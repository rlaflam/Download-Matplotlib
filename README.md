Hi there 💻☕

My name is rlaflam and I'm getting started out on contributing to GitHub.
There's nothing more frustrating when trying to use a terminal command and it returns errors!
My goal is to contribute by posting the work arounds that I find.

Soon I will adding my completed projects 🎉.
I have created small Python IDLE projects.
And I create networking projects using Cisco's Packet Tracer. 

Fun things coming to my page. So, stay tuned! 
🙂✌️
